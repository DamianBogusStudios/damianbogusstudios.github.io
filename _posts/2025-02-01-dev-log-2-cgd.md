# üéÆ Introduction

Since the last update, I've been working on adding new features and polishing existing ones. If you're just joining, check out [Dev Log #1](#) to catch up on my initial steps and challenges.

In this update, we've tackled:
- Character animations and room joining issues.
- Custom shaders for interactable objects.
- Lag compensation for smoother gameplay.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Character Models & Animations

One of the first things I wanted to get working was synchronizing animations and models. Since players will be able to customize and pick their own character models, these models must be instantiated at runtime by each client.

The built-in **PhotonAnimatorView** component syncs animations but only works when the model is already part of the base prefab. When instantiating models dynamically, the animation view wouldn't sync with the parent **PhotonView**.

### üé≠ Solution: Manual Animator Synchronization

The solution was to manually synchronize the animator parameters. I created a `PlayerAnimController` script that attaches to the base player prefab. When prompted via an **RPC call**, a model is instantiated, and its animator reference is passed to the controller.

#### üîÑ Instantiating Character Models
```c#
[PunRPC]
private void InstantiateCharacter(int ownerViewID, string modelPath)
{
    var owner = PhotonView.Find(ownerViewID);
    if (owner && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(modelPath))
    {
        var model = Resources.Load<GameObject>(modelPath);
        var modelTransform = Instantiate(model, owner.transform).transform;
        modelTransform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;
        modelTransform.localRotation = Quaternion.identity;

        GetComponent<PlayerAnimController>().animator =
            modelTransform.GetComponent<Animator>();
    }
}
```

#### üì° Syncing Animator Parameters
Using the `IPunObservable` interface, we synchronize the animation values between clients.

```c#
public void OnPhotonSerializeView(PhotonStream stream, PhotonMessageInfo info)
{
    if (stream.IsWriting)
    {
        stream.SendNext(xVal);
        stream.SendNext(yVal);
    }
    else
    {
        xVal = (float)stream.ReceiveNext();
        yVal = (float)stream.ReceiveNext();
    }
}
```

To smooth movement updates, we apply damping in the `Update()` method.

```c#
void Update()
{
    if (inputHandler != null && photonView.IsMine)
    {
        xVal = inputHandler.MoveInput.x;
        yVal = inputHandler.MoveInput.z;
    }

    if (animator)
    {
        animator.SetFloat(moveX, xVal, directionDamp, Time.deltaTime);
        animator.SetFloat(moveY, yVal, directionDamp, Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

And the final result:

## üîÑ Room Synchronization - Late Joiners

Initially, our game didn‚Äôt support late joiners, as players are meant to be in a fixed group. However, to handle cases like disconnections, I implemented a solution allowing players to **rejoin the game**.

### üèóÔ∏è Handling Late Joiners

I experimented with pausing the message queue on PhotonNetwork. The queue would then be resumed once the client had loaded into the game scene. This didn't work... My hunch was that the instantiation calls were executed before the scene change and as a result the models would actually delete once it had finished

The breakthrough came with the use of custom room properties. When the master client starts the game and loads the next scene, they also set the gameStarted property to true. With this, instead of using buffered `PhotonNetwork.Instantiate()` any late players simply load into the game scene locally before trying to join the room. 

```c#
public static void JoinRoom(RoomInfo roomInfo)
{
    if (roomInfo.CustomProperties.TryGetValue(RoomProperties.GameStarted, out object GameStarted) && (bool)GameStarted)
    {
        PlayerPrefs.SetString(RoomProperties.RoomKey, roomInfo.Name);
        SceneManager.LoadScene(1);
    }
    else
    {
        PhotonNetwork.JoinRoom(roomInfo.Name);
        MenuManager.Instance.OpenMenu("loading");
    }
}
```

On scene load, we check if the player is already in a room. If not, they attempt to rejoin.

```c#
private void Start()
{
    if (PhotonNetwork.CurrentRoom != null)
        InstantiateNewPlayer();
    else  
        PhotonNetwork.JoinRoom(PlayerPrefs.GetString("RoomKey"));
}
```

The `OnJoinedRoom` callback ensures late joiners spawn correctly.

```c#
public override void OnJoinedRoom()
{
#if DEBUGGING
    Debug.Log("Late Joiner, Instantiate Player Character");
#endif
    InstantiateNewPlayer();
}
```

## üåê Lag Compensation

I started implementing **lag compensation** to ensure smoother gameplay. One key aspect was synchronizing each client‚Äôs **camera pitch** so players can see what others are aiming at.

### üéØ Syncing Camera Pitch

Using `IPunObservable`, we transmit the camera‚Äôs pitch value.

```c#
private void HandleClientSync()
{
    var oldPitchValue = mainCamera.transform.localEulerAngles.x;
    oldPitchValue = (oldPitchValue > 180) ? oldPitchValue - 360 : oldPitchValue;

    var targetPitchValue = Mathf.SmoothDamp(oldPitchValue, pitchValue, ref smoothVelocity, smoothTime);
    mainCamera.transform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(targetPitchValue, 0, 0);
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Game Mechanics & Shaders

### üîÑ Interactable Items

To implement interactable items, I created an `IInteractable` interface with methods for focus detection and interaction.

```c#
public interface IInteractable
{
    public bool Interactable {get; set;}
    public abstract void OnFocus();
    public abstract void OnExitFocus();
    public abstract void OnInteract(int ownerViewID);
}
```
Additionally, we created an `IEquippable` interface extending interactable items for equipment mechanics.

### üó°Ô∏è Item Class

I also created a base class for these items. This was class was designed as abstract and would house all the lag compensation and synchronisation code. It also implements the interface but declares the functions as virtual allowing child classes to implement their own behaviours.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/devlogs/devlog2/item.webp)

Toggling between isKinematic on the rigidbody caused issues the solution was to toggle the reference from the rigidbody to the transfrom

![Desktop View](/assets/img/devlogs/devlog2/to.webp)

You can then lerp the position to the adjusted network position

![Desktop View](/assets/img/devlogs/devlog2/lerp position.webp)


### üî¶ The Torch

Our first interactable item was a **torch** that reveals hidden clues when activated. The base class implements the RPC calls. 

![Desktop View](/assets/img/devlogs/devlog2/torch-interaction.webp)

**nameof** is used to preserve function references. the calls sync the state of the torch with clients. 

 a **PointLight** is attached to the GameObject. The ToggleTorch RPC changes the intensity of that light accordingly. In this function we are also passing through the state from the interacting clients. This should  prevent the on/off state of the torch going out of sync for the players.

#### üñåÔ∏è Custom Shader for Hidden Clues

To reveal hidden clues only when illuminated, we created a shader that modifies an object‚Äôs alpha based on light intensity and direction.

```c#
float strength = (-dotProduct) - cosThreshold;
strength *= smoothAttenuation * clampedIntensity;
return faceColor * strength * input.color.a
```

And here is the result:
